# Spotify_Data_Analysis

Taking the top 30 songs from my on repeat playlist and wrangling the data to be processed by Spotify's audio features query.
I then extracted the energy values and averaged them to give myself a personal energy score to determine how energetic my most listened to songs are.
The answer is 64%.
